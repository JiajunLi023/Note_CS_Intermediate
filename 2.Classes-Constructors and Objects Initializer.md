### What is Constructor?
>A method that is called when an instance of class is created.

### Why we need constructor?
>To put an object in an early state. 
>Help to initialize the data of object.

### How to declare a constructor?
```
public class Person()
{
      public Person(parameters)
      {
      }
}
```
>Use the name of class without return tpye.

### How to initialize the object?
>1. If there is no parameter in the (): default all data, int - 0; string - null; char - empty...
>2.if there are parameter in the ():
```
public class Person()
{
      public int Age;
      public string Name;
      public Person(int age, string name)
      {
          this.Age = age;
          this.Name = name;
      }
}
```
>Use `this.NameOfData` to initialize 

### Which data is need to be chosen as first initialization?
>If there are many fields need to be initialized, choose important one to initialize but not all of them.

### Is there only keyword help to create constructors?
```
public Person(int id)
        {
            this.Id = id;
        }
        public Person(int id, string name)
            :this(id)
        {
            this.Name = name;
        }
```
>`:this(id)` is used to do `public Person(int id)` before doing `this.Name = name;` 
>`:this(..)` is always used for neccessary initialization for each constructors.

### What is Object Initializer?
>A syntax used to initialize obejct

### Why do we use the Object Initializer?
> To avoid create lots of constructors.

### How to use the Object Initializer?
```
var person = new Person
            {
                  Age = 12,
                  Name = "Jay"
            }
```
