### What is Abstract?
>To indicate that a class or a member is missing implementation  
>For example:  
```
 public class Shape
    {
        public int Height { get; set; }
        public int Width { get; set; }

        public void Draw()
        {

        }

    }
```
>There is no implementation in Shape class, so we can use abstract in this class.

### How to use Acstract?
```
 public abstract class Shape
    {
        public int Height { get; set; }
        public int Width { get; set; }

        public abstract void Draw()     // abstract in override method is like virtual
        {

        }

    }
```

### What is the rule of Abstract?
>1. If a member is declared as abstract, the containing class needs to be declared as abstract too.
```
 public abstract class Shape           // has to declare the class as abstract
    {
        public int Height { get; set; }
        public int Width { get; set; }

        public abstract void Draw()     // abstract in override method is like virtual
        {

        }

    }
```
>2. Must implement all abstract members in the base abstract class.(means has to override the method in inheritance class)
```
 public class Circle : Shape
    {
        public override void Draw()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Draw a circle.");
        }
    }
```
>3.Cannot be instantiated
```
var shape = new Shape();    // this cannot be complied
```

### Why to use Abstract?
>When you want to provide some common behaviour, while forcing other developers to follow your design
