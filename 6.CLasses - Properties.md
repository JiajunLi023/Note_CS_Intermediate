### What are properties?
>A class member that encapsulates a getter/setter for accessing a field.

### Why we need properties?
>To create a getter/setter with less code

### How to declear a property?
>Hot key: prop + Tab  
```
public DateTime Birthdate { get; set; }     //auto-implemented way
public int Age 
{ 
    get 
    {
          var timeSpan = DateTime.Today - Birthdate;
          var year = timeSpan.Days / 365;
          return year;
    }
        
}
```

### How about private set?
```
public DateTime Birthdate { get; private set; }

        public Person(DateTime birthdate)
        {
            Birthdate = birthdate;
        }
```
>When use private set, we can't difine data in object and have to use constructor.
