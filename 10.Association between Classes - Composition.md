### What is Composition?
>A kind of relationship between two classes that allows one to contain the order.

### What is the benefits of Composition?
>1.Code re-use  
>2.Flexibility  
>A means to loose-coupling  

### How to use a Composition?
>Example:
>DbMigrator requires logging  
>Installer requires logging
>So we need to create a class used for logging
```
public class Logger                   //Logger is the class which other class has
    {
        public int number { get; set; }

        public void Do()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(++number);
        }
    }
public class Dbmigrator
    {
        public Logger Logger { get; set; }          //We need to create a object of Logger there and use constructor to initialize it.

        public Dbmigrator()
        {
            Logger = new Logger();                 //So we can use the function of Logger class in the method of Dbmigrator.
        }
        
        public void Migrate()
        {
            Logger.Do();
            Console.WriteLine("good");
        }

    }
```
