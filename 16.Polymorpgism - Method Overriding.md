### What is Overriding?
> Modifying the implementation of an inherited method.  
> For example:  
```
public class Shape 
{
    public void Draw()
}

public class Circle : Shape
{

}
public class Rectangle : Shape
{

}
```
> class Circle and Rectangle both need the Draw method but they need to modify the method to what they specificly need.  
> So they need to use Overriding method.  

### How to Overriding?
> Use ***virtual*** and ***override***  
```
public class Shape 
{
    public virtual void Draw()
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
              //add specific impelemention in there
         base.Draw() // also can use the base Draw in base class(Shape)
    }
}
```
