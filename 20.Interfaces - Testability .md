### What is the Hot Key of Creating Interface?
> control + shift + R

### How to create a Unit Test?
>Solution - Add - Test - Unit Test Project. 
>Name of Method in test project: MethodName_Condition_Expectation.   
>eg: Process_OrderIsAlreadyShipped_ThrowAnException. 

### How to code the Unit test?
>It is like a Main function. You need to isolate every exacuation to test.
>But If there are other class used in one exacuation
>eg: 
```
public void Process(Order order)          // In this method which need to be test has two excuations and we need to isolate them
{
    if(order.IsShipped)
        throw new InvalidOperationException("This order is already processed.")
    
    order.Shipment = new Shipment {cost = _shippingCalculator.CalculateShipping(order), ShipTime = DateTime.Today.AddDays(1)};    
    // In this exacuation, use other class's function, so need to make that class to interface and create a fakefunction without logic in UnitTEst.
}
```
>UnitTest
```
[TesClass]
public class OrderProcessTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void Process_OrderIsAlreadyShipped_ThrowAnException()
    {
        var orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor(new FakeShippingCalculator());
        var order = new Order {Shipment = new Shipemnt()};      // create a order which has been shipped.
        orderProcessor.Process(order);
        
    }
}

public class FakeShippingCalculator : IShippingCalculator         //create a fake function without logic
{
    public float CalculateShipping(Order order)
    {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

### Other functions used for test
```
Assert.IsTure(parameter);          //decide whether the parameter what you need is true 
Assert.AreEqual(parameter,number);    //decide whether the parameters are equal to what you want.
```
>use these functions to decide whether our logic is correct.
