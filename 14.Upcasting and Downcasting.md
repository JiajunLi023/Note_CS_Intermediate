### WHat is Upcasting and Downcasting?
>Upcasting: convert a derived class to base class (son to parents)  
>Downcasting: convert a base class to derived class (parents to son)

### How to do Upcasting and Downcasting in code?
```
public class Vehicle
{
    
}
public class Car : Vehicle
{

}
public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var car  = new Car();
        Vehicle vehicle = car;    //upcasting. Attention: in this time, vehicle and car are pointing the same object and 
                                  //when use car it is Car type and use vehicle it is vehicle type. They will share field in case class.
        
        Car anothercar = (Car)vehicle; //downcasting
        
    }
}
```

***when you convert a class to a non-base or non-derived class, it will throw a exception***
***And at that time, we need to use as or is keywords***

### How to use **as** or **is** keyword?
```
var customer = new Customer();
Car car = customer as Car;    // Actually they are unrelated clss so car will become Null.
if (car != Null)
{
}

// Or use is
if (customer is Car)        // is means inheritance relationship
{
    Car car = (Car) customer; 
}
```
