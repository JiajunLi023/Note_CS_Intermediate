### How to initialize the Fields which have to be initialized?
>1.Constructors. But for constructors, every constructor has to initialize once.   
>2.Initialization at the beginning.
```
public List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
```
>So we don't need to initialize in every constructors anymore.  

### What is readonly field?
```
public readonly List<Order> Orders = new List<Order>();
```
>When using `readonly` in the code, the variable can't be assigend to(except constructors and a variable initialization)
```
public void Promotion()       //a new method
{
    Orders = new List<Order>();     // This code won't compile because Orders is readonly which can't be assigned to in a method.
}
```
