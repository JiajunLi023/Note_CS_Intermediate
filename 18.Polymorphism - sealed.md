### What is Sealed?
>To prevents derivation of classes or overriding of methods(if one class is sealed, can not make a inheritanc of it. And if one method is sealed, cannot override it)

### How to use Sealed?
```
 public sealed class Circle : Shape        //Then cannot create class derivated from Circle.
    
        public override void Draw()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Draw a circle.");
        }
    }
    
 public class Triangle : Shape
    {
        public sealed override void Draw()      //this method cannot be overrided by its derivation class
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Draw a circle.");
        }
    }
```

### Why to use Sealed?
>Sealed classes are slightly faster becasue of some run-time optimizations.
