### How do inheritance constructor work?
>1. Base class constructors are always executed first. When there are default constructor, it will execuate default constructor firstly.
>2. Base class constructors are not inherited.

### How to use base keyword?
> When you need to initialize a private field, you can use base keyword to pass to base constructors to initialize.
```
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public Car(string registrationNumber)
        : base(registrationNumber)
        {
            // Initialise fields specific to the Car class
         }
}
```

### Why has to use base keyword?
```
public class Vehicle
{
    private string _registrationNumber
    public Vehicle(string registrationNumber)
        {
            _registrationNumber = registrationNUmber;
         }
}
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    public Car(string registrationNumber)
        {
            _registrationNumber = registrationNUmber;  // Becasue _registrationNumber is private so it can't be initialized like this.
         }
}
```
